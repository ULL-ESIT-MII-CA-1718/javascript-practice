Note: Because I use Sublime Text with the JavaScriptCore framework (a command-line tool in OS X), I use debug() instead of console.log(). Sublime Text also handles tab size differently, which is noticeable when the code is pasted elsewhere, such as here on GitHub. 

July 11, 2015 update: Fixed tab size difference in my Sublime Text.
